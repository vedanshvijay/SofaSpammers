# Office IP Messenger ðŸš€

> "Because sometimes yelling across the office just isn't professional enough"

Tired of your coworkers seeing your meme collection when you share your screen? Sick of your boss catching you chatting about weekend plans on Slack? Introducing **Office IP Messenger** - the messaging app that's so local, even your IT department won't know it exists! ðŸ˜Ž

## Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Because waiting for emails is so 2010
- **File sharing**: Share cat memes at lightning speed (or work documents, whatever)
- **User authentication**: No more "who the heck is this?" moments
- **End-to-end encryption**: Your secrets are safe (unless you're using "password123")
- **Local network discovery**: Find your work BFFs automatically
- **Desktop notifications**: Never miss a coffee break invite again
- **Cross-platform support**: Works on your work laptop, your personal laptop, and that old computer in the break room

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher (because we're not living in the stone age)
- pip (Python package manager - it's like npm but for people who like snakes)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository (or download it if you're not into that whole git thing):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/officeipmess.git
   cd officeipmess
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (it's like a safe space for your Python packages):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (this is where the magic happens):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application (and pray it works):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Building from Source

Want to feel like a real developer? Build it yourself:
```bash
# On Windows
./create_installer.bat

# On Mac/Linux
./create_installer.sh
```

The executable will be created in the `build` directory (if everything goes according to plan).

## Usage

1. Launch the application (and hope it doesn't crash)
2. Enter your username (no, "xXx_ProGamer_xXx" is not professional)
3. The application will automatically discover other users (or not, who knows?)
4. Start messaging! (responsibly, of course)

## Security

- All messages are encrypted using industry-standard encryption (probably)
- No data is stored on external servers (unless you count that old computer in accounting)
- All communication happens over your local network (so don't try using this from home)

## Contributing

Want to make this app suck less? Here's how:
1. Fork the repository (like a proper developer)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request (and pray the maintainer is in a good mood)
